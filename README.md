This application serves as a database for storing car related data,
such as trips, expenses and so on. There is also the ability to display
statistics to get a better view on what kind of costs are related
to a car. It can be used for your private vehicles or even
for some company related vehicles.

As for the most projects that I created, a console application is a good
way to start, as it can be extended to syncing with a server. For now all data is only stored on
the local hard drive.

Currently (29th January 2024) the statistics feature is not implemented yet, but will add this
definetly later on : )
